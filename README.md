# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 🌀

A Python-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built with **Tkinter** that lets user watch popular sorting algorithms in action. This interactive tool is perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about how different sorting methods work under the hood.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms step-by-step
- Intuitive and clean GUI using Tkinter
- Adjustable speed for sorting animations
- Change the size of the array and shuffle it randomly
- Educational and beginner-friendly codebase

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI rendering
- **Random** – for generating arrays
- **Time** – for controlling visualization speed

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
Run the app: python main.py

📊 Algorithms Included
1. Bubble Sort - 
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.


2. Selection Sort - 
Selection Sort divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.


3. Insertion Sort - 
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time, placing each new element at the correct position relative to the previously sorted elements.


4. Merge Sort - 
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.


5. Quick Sort - 
Quick Sort selects a pivot element and partitions the array such that elements less than the pivot go left, and those greater go right. It recursively applies this process to subarrays.


6. Heap Sort - 
Heap Sort turns the list into a max heap and then repeatedly swaps the first and last element, reducing the heap size each time and maintaining the heap.
